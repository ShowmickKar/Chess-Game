# Bugfix
Due to the svg files for the kings and knights both having the same name, for white it is W-k and for black, it is B-k, this resulted in the file for the king svg to be replaced, and the python code only using the knight svg for both king and knight. Since the file system is not case sensitive, it is important to differentiate between kings and knights. To fix the bug, I renamed the knight files to "W-n" and "B-n" and the king files to "W-k" and "B-k".
